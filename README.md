## Overview
This is my first project in FrontEnd Mentor. It is a code for the QR component of a website. It bascially provides access to the FrontEnd Mentor website by scanning the given QR code. I hope you like my imitation.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Visual Studio Code


### What I learned

I learnt how to add colours using the var() property and how to import fonts from Google Fonts. It also helped me in remebering syntax and tags I had forgotten. 

```css
body {
    background-color: var(--light-gray);
    font-family: "Montserrat", sans-serif;
}
```


### Continued development

I will like to try out more projects on HTML and CSS for now. I will prefer beginner-intermediate CSS projects so that I can sharpen my skills. I would later like to progress to more complex challenges involving Javascript.  

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://youtu.be/SR5GxoFhIAU) - This introduced me to FrontEnd Mentor and taught me how to accept challenges and submit soutions. It doesn't teach this challenge but it helped in understanding the basics.
